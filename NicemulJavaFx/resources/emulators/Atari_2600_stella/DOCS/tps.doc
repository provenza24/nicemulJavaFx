Playing Instructions

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object of Game: Pilot your lander craft down onto the platforms and a
colonist will run to you and get onboard. Take off and bring him back to the
mothership safely. You can only carry one colonist at a time, so you need to
make a complete round trip for each one. You start out with four lander
vehicles. Continue saving colonists until you crash your last lander, at
which time it's game over. If you fail to save at least one of the three
colonists during one round (eg. they all die during your rescue efforts),
it's also game over, regardless of how many landers you have in reserve.
Consider your pilot's license revoked.

Controls: Only the Reset button and the joystick are used. Start a new game
by pressing the Reset button, then use the joystick to play. Launch the
lander from the mothership by pressing the fire button. At that point
gravity takes control and the ship will free fall. Press the fire button to
overcome gravity and move upwards. Move the joystick left and right to move
the lander in that direction. You can move diagonally upward by pressing the
fire button and either left or right on the joystick at the same time. The
effect of gravity will cause your ship to slow down and coast upward for a
brief time after you stop pressing the fire button. Likewise, when falling
it will not reach full speed immediately, but accelerates. It will take some
practice for you to master control of the lander craft.

The Screen: From the top to the bottom, here is a description of what's on
the screen:

     4 digit score

     2 digit fuel guage

     Mothership

     Transition zone from outer atmosphere to orbital space

     The outer atmosphere, populated by asteroids and enemy space craft

     The inner atmosphere (or landing zone), consisting of three platforms,
     each with a colonist at the beginning of a round

     Status line, showing the ships remaining in the game, and the number of
     colonists rescued so far in the current round

Scoring: You receive points for each colonist you take on board. The
colonist on the center (large) platform is worth 5 points. The left (medium)
platform is worth 15 points. The right (small) platform is worth 50 points.
At the end of each round, which lasts until all three colonists are either
rescued or killed, you *may* receive several bonus scores. A 250 point
perfect score bonus is awarded for returning all three colonists safely to
the mother ship. You receive one point for each unit of fuel you have
remaining at the end of the round. You also receive a bonus for each
colonist safely returned to the mothership. This final bonus varies
depending on the round you have just played:

     round 1: 10 points per colonist

     round 2: 20 "

     round 3: 30 "

     round 4: 40 "

     round 5: 50 "

     round 6 and above: 60 points per colonist

You will receive three times the above bonus scores in addition to the 250
point award for a perfect round.

Playing Tips:

     1. Don't touch any other flying objects. As the game progresses,
     asteroids and enemy space ships move more quickly. Also watch out for
     missiles fired by the enemy. They move laterally as they fall to the
     planet surface, but they disintegrate when reaching the inner
     atmosphere. Your lander as well as the colonists are safe from missiles
     when in the landing zone.

          Hint: The enemy craft shoot only one missile at a time. So, after
          you are clear of a missile, but it is still visible, use this time
          to navigate safely below other enemy ships you might ordinarily
          avoid.

     2. Don't land at full speed. Slow down before making contact with the
     landing platform. This just takes practice.

          Hint: You only crash when going maximum speed. Practice free
          falling from various heights to get a feel for just how high you
          can be and safely drop to a platform.

     3. Don't touch the colonists while your craft is in the air, or they
     will die. There is no telling which direction a colonist might run to
     next, so you'll have to just try for the best position you can and hope
     he doesn't run for your ship before you've actually landed! Ignore dead
     colonists, as their twitching bodies are of no use to you.

          Hint: If you are running low on fuel, but have rescued at least
          one colonist, consider killing the last man and returning to the
          mothership to complete the round and avoid the risk of losing a
          ship to an out of fuel condition.

     4. Don't try to land on the surface of the planet. It's molten and your
     ship will explode. The three platforms are the only safe landing areas,
     but you have to land directly on top of them. Touching them on the
     sides will also crash your ship. You can safely land on a platform with
     only one of the lander's feet touching, but you have to at least get
     the main portion onto the platform. Barely touching it won't be good
     enough.

          Hint: The lander craft controls are pretty easy to adjust within
          one pixel. Learn what a safe landing is by experimentally tapping
          the lander left and right and landing right on the edge of a
          platform.

     5. Keep an eye on your fuel guage. When it hits zero, you lose a ship.
     Fuel is consumed by either upward or sideways motion. Moving upward
     consumes a bit more fuel than moving sideways and moving diagonally
     upward consumes fuel fastest of all.

          Hint: Obviously the less fuel you use the higher your score. Learn
          to land and return as fuel efficiently as possible.

     6. To dock with the mothership, fly up and try to get as close to the
     center opening as you can. Once you leave the outer atmosphere, if you
     are within the proper docking range, your lander will be pulled aboard.
     If not, you crash.

          Hint: One of the enemy space ships will never shoot at you. Can
          you guess which one?
